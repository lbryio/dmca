This is my work that has been infringed. Link: https://youtu.be/6XnKM9TH8Fw This is a video of me playing and singing all the instruments of a cover for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opening theme with alternate veganism promoting lyrics that I wrote. This was released by me on March 31st 2018. The lyrics, performance and production are my copyright.

I have found multiple mirrors of a Sverige video on your website, where my material is inserted into the video without fair use, without my consent or prior knowledge. Almost half of my original video is present in the infringing video. Usually the time index where it is inserted is at 7:41-8:09, but sometimes changes to the original video may cause variation in this. Here are some links where I found the infringing video on your website.

Since Sverige, the original uploader of the video on YouTube (link to original infringing video which was claimed by me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPUTH0ZOBJ4) has requested his audience re-upload the video to multiple websites including your own, and having found 16 mirrors on YouTube, 4 mirrors on your website and 1 mirror on Mediafire for which I have submitted a copyright complaint for all of them, I suggest and request if possible that you implement an automated system to prevent re-upload of this content in the future unless explicitly authorized by me via one of my contact options provided below.

You can contact me at ruthless.peleg@gmail.com, misxxxxxess@gmail.com or via phone at xxxxxxx.

I am the owner of the copyright material and have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained is not authorized by me. It was inserted into these videos and uploaded without my prior knowledge or consent without fair use.

The information in this notice is true and accurate and under penalty of perjury, as the owner of the copyright I am authorized to act and complain about it.

Immediately below is my real name which constitutes my electronic signature.
