A website that hosts your business (based on WHOIS information) infringes at least one copyright owned by my business.

This letter is an official notice under Section 512 (c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the violator of this notice and advise them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to stop any further posting of the infringing material to your server in the future.

Also note that you, as a service provider, are required by law to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receipt of this notice. Under US law, a service provider, like you, has immunity from a copyright lawsuit as long as it acts with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringements. If the service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the material offender, this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from copyright infringement action, you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or disable the infringing material from your servers promptly should the direct infringer, your customer, , do not comply immediately.

I provide this notice in good faith and in the reasonable belief that my company's rights are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury, I certify that the information in the notification is true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the copyright owner involved.

If you would like to discuss this with me, please contact me directly.

Thank you.
