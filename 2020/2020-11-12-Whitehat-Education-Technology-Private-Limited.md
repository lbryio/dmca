Counter DMCA:

Hello

My 12 videos were removed from LBRY account:https://lbry.tv/@WhiteHatSr:e
The DMCA complaints which you must have received from most probably someone from WhiteHatJr company is false. They DO NOT own the videos in what so ever manner.

Short summary of the issue: There is a scam company called WhiteHatJr which is scamming poor parents and their kids in these pandemic times. I made videos to expose this scam. Those videos were basically my opinion about the company, my questions regarding their unethical behavior, false marketing, poor product, and fake reviews on google play store. The companies ORM team started removing my videos and eventually, 2 of my youtube channels got suspended.
Hence I made an account on LBRY.
After 2 months of appeals and social media awareness campaign, ALL my videos got reinstated by youtube. Please check this Forbes Article to validate what I have said above.

Please reinstate my videos as I own all those videos, which even youtube has expected.

Regards
Pradeep Poonia.
