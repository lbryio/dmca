To whom it may concern at Odysee:

My name is James Shupe.

A user that your company hosts on your platform and service (Smokinfeds posting as anonymous) is infringing on at least one copyright owned by me.

An article belonging to me was copied onto your servers without my permission. The original ARTICLE/PHOTOS, to which I own the exclusive copyrights, was formerly located at, but has since been removed:

https://autogynephilia.substack.com/p/autogynephilia-in-search-of-my-cure

The article now resides here, also without my permission for use and efforts are ongoing to remove it:

https://archive.fo/https://autogynephilia.substack.com/p/autogynephilia-in-search-of-my-cure

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at on your service:

https://odysee.com/smokinfeds:3

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

In this case also, the user is also ordered to stop harassing me and my wife. I have been receiving threatening emails and viruses from the email account: smokinfeds@gmail.com

Please also be advised that applicable law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that copyrights I own are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.

James Shupe
