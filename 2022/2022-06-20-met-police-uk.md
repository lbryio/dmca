Dear Odysee Team,

I hope you are all well.

We are currently managing a considerable amount of risk generated by the creation of two tracks by the aspiring artist, AbzSav. These track have been uploaded to your platform under the channel named UK Drill Archive. I have attached a picture of the channel to this email.

The title of the two track we would like to bring to your attention are:

• Tables Turn https://odysee.com/@ukdrill:a/abzsavtablesturn1:7
• Tables Turn 2.0 https://odysee.com/@ukdrill:a/Abzsavtablesturn2.0:2


I have attached a complete transcription of both tracks. I have included the adlibs and in brackets I have includes a translation of some of the slang words used.

Both tracks step outside the realms of the Drill Genre and firmly into the Gang Related music category.

The third track on this channel is named : #Zone2 Karma x Trizzac - Dead. This track is also littered with lyrics aimed at dead males by naming / mocking them for being murdered by males affiliated to the artists themselves.

Example Lyrics

00:38 "lil CJ thought he had some heart, his top got left all red, he got killed, matter of fact he got left for dead, Same way Latz got thrown off the ped"

The reference to Lil CJ is the Late Clinton Evbota, he was stabbed to death in Camberwell 2019. The artist is mocking the death of another from a rivalling group, this is encouraging violence aimed at this group. The friends and family of the late Clinton Evbota do not deserved to be bullied through the lyrics of a gang related music video.

The murder is detailed here:

The disrespectful reference to Latz was the nickname for the Late Latwaan Griffiths. He was stabbed multiple times, pushed off a moped and left to die along Denmark Road in July 2018.

SK is the late Sadique Kamara who was also murdered. The drill artist is revelling in the deaths of both Rhyhiem Barton and Sadique Kamara suggesting they killed the wrong person the first time but they eventually killed them both.

I respectfully request that The channel UK Drill Archive is removed and the music tracks referred are no longer available on your platform. This is to assist with the risk of serious physical harm or death created by the uploads. There is obvious malicious and revelling intent behind the creation of the videos, acts of gang related violence are being glorified which is very dangerous.

There are numerous lyrical threats and taunts aimed at named rival affiliates, areas and rival gangs.

This is not art and can never be considered to be.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding these referrals, I await your response.



Kind Regards
