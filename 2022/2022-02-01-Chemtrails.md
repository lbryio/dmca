This letter is an official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek removal of the above infringing material from your servers. I request that you promptly notify the infringer of this notice and advise them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease posting further infringing material on your server in the future.

Please also note that you, as the service provider, are required by law to remove or disable access to infringing materials upon receipt of this notice. Under U.S. law, a service provider, such as you, is immune from a copyright claim as long as it acts with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers fail to investigate and remove or disable the infringing material, this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action, you must investigate and ultimately remove or disable the infringing material from your servers in a timely manner in the event that the direct infringer, your customer, does not immediately comply.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with a reasonable belief that rights owned by my company are being infringed. Under penalties of perjury, I certify that the information contained in the notice is true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright involved.

If you wish to discuss this with me, please contact me directly.

Thank you.
