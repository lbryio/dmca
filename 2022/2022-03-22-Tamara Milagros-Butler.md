Re: Dropkick Murphys / Unauthorized Use of music composition and sound recording in Odysee video / Notice of
Infringement of Copyright / Cease & Desist Demand
To whom it may concern:
I represent Dropkick Murphys (“DKM”). DKM recorded and retains rights in and to the sound recording “The Boys Are Back”
(the “Recording”) as well as the musical composition embodied therein (the “Composition”). The Nationalist Social Club (a/k/a NSC 131)
has used the Recording and the Composition in a video (the “Video”) (link below) and has broadcast and/or authorized third parties to
broadcast the Video over the internet, including, without limitation, on Odysee.
https://odysee.com/@NSC131:7/NSC131SAINTPATRICKSDAY:b
DKM has not (and would not, ever, in a million years) authorize or license to NSC 131 the right to use or exploit the Recording
and/or Composition in the Video in question or any similar video.
The performance, synchronization, reproduction and broadcast of the Recording and the Composition by NSC 131, among other
things, are violations of United States copyright law and any continued use will constitute illegal and willful copyright
infringement.
On behalf of DKM I demand that you immediately:
1. Cease and desist from any and all uses of the Recording and/or Composition, in and as part of the Video or otherwise; and
2. Provide details regarding all uses or exploitations of the Recording and/or Composition made by you, and/or authorized,
licensed, or approved by you, in and as part of the Video or otherwise, in any media platform, including but not limited to, the
internet and social media outlets, (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, etc.).
We’ll take your immediate compliance as confirmation that you received this letter. If, however, you fail to immediately comply,
then my client and their designees and assignees are prepared to take whatever legal action they deem necessary and appropriate to
protect their rights in and to the Recording and Composition, including, without limitation, seeking statutory and punitive damages for
your copyright infringement and unfair trade practices.
Nothing contained in or omitted from this letter shall constitute an admission of any facts or a waiver of any of DKM’s or any of
its designees or assignees claims, rights or remedies, whether at law or in equity, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.
We are all One,
Tamara Milagros-Butler, Esq.
