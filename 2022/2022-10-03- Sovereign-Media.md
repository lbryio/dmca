Hello,

These videos were made using narration that is taken directly from copyrighted text published in our magazines. This text was recited word-for-word from our magazines as narration for his videos. The owner / producer has admitted this to us in an e-mail and we responded by telling him he does not have our permission.

The owner / producer has been notified directly to cease and desist using our content, and he has refused to cooperate. These videos are also on YouTube, and they have begun taking his videos down, which is probably what he is moving to you.

Carl Gnam
Editorial Director
