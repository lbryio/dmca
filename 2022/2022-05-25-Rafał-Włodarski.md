Hello, Attached you can find the lawsuit and a decision of the Civil Court in Wrocław from June 30, 2021 under case number I C 978/21 to transfer the case of the lawsuit against Mr. Piotr Widera (the uploader) for copyright protection to the Civil Court in Poznań. This serves as evidence that the case is pending before the courts. They are now transferring the case to each other because a special District Court for the protection of intellectual property was established in Poznań.
