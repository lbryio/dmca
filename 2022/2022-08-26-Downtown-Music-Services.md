This video is infringing on, and in violation of, our copyright rights. The entire video is accompanied by an unauthorized misappropriation and infringement of the composition entitled "Motherland" by Natalie Merchant (the "Composition"). The lyrics of the Composition have been changed to reflect hateful neo-nazi sentiments that are misleading and abhorent to Downtown and Ms. Merchant and bastardize the meaning of the original song.

Timestamp 0:20: The original lyrics "far from the sprawl of the concrete that keeps crawling its way about 1,000 miles a day" have been changed to "far from the blood and the soil that's been ours before for a 1,000 years or more."

"Blood and soil" is a Nazi slogan which claims that ethnicity is based solely on blood descent and the territory one maintains, popularized by the prominent Nazi theorist Richard Walther Darr√© in 1930, three years before he became Hitler's minister of food and agriculture.

In addition to copyright infringement, this video also violates your policy against promoting hatred against any group of people. Patriotic Alternative is well known to be a racist, antisemitic, fascist and anti-LGBT group that promotes conspiracy theories to promote hatred and violence against vulnerable communities. See timestamp 2:17 for White Lives Matters flags, a phrase used to protest against "black lives matter'' by white people, to protect their traditional white prerogatives and privileges and seeks to deny the very real plight of Black communities dealing with violence and death at the hands of the police.

By continuing to exploit this video, Odysee is complicit in this messaging.

Neither Downtown nor Ms. Merchant have authorized any use of the Composition by Patriotic Alternative and demand that you immediately cease and desist from the exploitation thereof. Failure to comply with this demand will leave Downtown with no choice but to explore its full range of legal and equitable rights and remedies under copyright, trademark and other applicable laws.
