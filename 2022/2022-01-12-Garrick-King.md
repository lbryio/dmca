My name is GARRICK KING and I am the AUTHOR of THE 1111 MATRIX CODE. A website/Odysee Channel that your company hosts (according to WHOIS information) is infringing on at least one copyright owned by me.

Please see photo evidence attached showing that I am GARRICK KING and that I am the COPYRIGHT owner of said work. Each screen shot is labeled with today's date and time stamp in which I am sending this letter.

Let it be also known that not only does this stand as 4 counts of Copyright Infringement, but it also stands as proof of Cyberbullying and an infringement to my personal rights to Privacy, as noted in your Policy! Steven J Graham not only lists my FULL name, but also images of my face.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you remove the infringing material IMMEDIATELY, and notify the owner of the channel to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that the rights that I own are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

I trust that my private information will not be shared by you or your partners and that all photographic evidence displaying private information be destroyed after viewing. If such evidence must be kept on file it must be done so in such a way that it remains completely private and confidential.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.

Garrick King
