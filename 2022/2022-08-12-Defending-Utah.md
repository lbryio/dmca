My name is Ahmed Shahzad Qureshi and I am the Owner of Deseret Family Learning, LLC, which owns the content and namesake of DefendingUtah.org, commonly known as "Defending Utah" to the public. A channel that your company hosts is infringing on a copyright owned by my company.

A channel was created on your servers, with the likeness of content copyrighted by "Defending Utah". The channel is pretending to represent my company, using my logo and descriptive information to mislead a user to believe it belongs to Defending Utah, while also intentionally redirecting the user to a competitor's website (treeoflibertysociety). They have also posted one video that is copyrighted by my company. All of this they have done without any permission. The fact that they have deliberately redirected attention to their own website is strong evidence of intentional fraud.

ORIGINAL CONTENT AND COPYRIGHT INFORMATION

The original content can be found at the following website, where you'll see the logo and name in common use, and the copyright notice at the bottom. This website has been in use since 2013.

www.DefendingUtah.org

The web page where the one video they're posting was originally shared is on this page. This video was produced to represent my company, using my logo, and company resources. It has gone through several iterations, but is the same content with my copyrighted material in it.

https://odysee.com/@TreeofLibertySociety:0/Utah's-Secret-Combinations:1

In these videos on Odysee you can see they are the same as the original, but the infringer has edited them to try to cover up my logo and namesake. In all of them, he has only partially succeeded in doing this.

Four example screenshots of infringing content, with some highlights, where you can see my brand plus his attempt to rebrand:

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers, both the video and the complete infringing channel. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.
