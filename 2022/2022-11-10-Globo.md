Dear all,

I hope you all are doing well. My name is Bárbara Cardoso and I work at Content Security Department at Globo. Globo (https://grupoglobo.globo.com/ (https://grupoglobo.globo.com/_) ) is the largest media company in Latin America and the increase of piracy is an important issue to our business . We have been noticing non-authorized videos from Globo, mostly on channels dedicated to our soap operas posted on the platform by regular users, such as the prints below. I read the copyright policy of the platform (Copyright Policy | Odysee Help Hub) and it says that the report must be done by using the bottom "report video". For our operational process this way of reporting is a bit complicated as we have found channels with plenty videos. It will take long time to report all the videos one by one. Instead of this flow, is it possible to send all the links at once in a e-mail or a form that allows us to add multiple links? If it's, so what additional information you will need? The basic info of a DMCA report?

I created a channel with our internal e-mail to make a first report to test how does it works (contentid@g.globo), but indeed the ideal way of reporting the links would be through e-mail or a form that may let us to send many links at once.

Can you please help us about this issue?
