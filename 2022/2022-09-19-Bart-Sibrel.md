Here is the link to my video on my channel: https://odysee.com/@BartSibrel:2/SD-Edited-with-Logo:c (This is a re-upload from my original version, which I upload first on Youtube on September 11, at 7:00 Central Time, which I took down on September 14 to add my watermark to avoid this problem in the future).

The video is called "Moon Landing Hoax Confession"

In good faith I am informing you that I am a professional filmmaker who has made his living as such for the last 35 years. This unauthorized upload on Odysee is part of a series that cost One Million Dollars to produce. Your user did not pay for it, we did. Unauthorized uploads effect our sales to recoup this cost.

The infringement is direct and full, an entire copy of my work that was just reupload.
