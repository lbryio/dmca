Good morning,

> Hi there can you give us some more information on this report?

With pleasure… I’m Sun, a privacy and security researcher and YouTuber.

My official website and channel are https://sunknudsen.com/ and https://www.youtube.com/sunknudsen.

The person behind https://odysee.com/@SunKnudsen:1 created a mirror of my content on Odysee without my consent using my identity (including my name “Sun Knudsen”, visual assets and description, all copied from my YouTube channel).

> In response to a complaint we received under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we have blocked access to this channel from our applications.

Thanks for removing content… that said, people are still going to follow channel given it uses my name, visual assets and description so I would like whole channel to be removed (or its ownership transferred to me).

Channel is essentially stealing my identity which is a crime in most countries aside from being a clear violation of copyright law.

Please let me know if I can help in any way. By the way, about a year ago, I registered https://odysee.com/@sunknudsen:d to “reserve” handle to make sure this would not happen.

How come can two people can use the same handle prefix (@sunknudsen) on Odysee?

Thanks for helping out,

Sun
