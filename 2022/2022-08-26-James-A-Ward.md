Hi,

Yes, this is copyright-infringing material. The scene that has been posted is from my feature film Identity Theft. The scene in question was ripped from the DVD commentary track, which I have never posted online, in any form. I'm the writer, director, producer, editor and I am in scene in question. I own the copyright and it is registered.

Below is the link where my DVDs can be purchased on Amazon.
