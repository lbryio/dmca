To the Designated Agent of Odysee,

Our firm, Reed Smith LLP, represents Lyric Capital Group. It has come to our attention that one or more users on Odysee are using Odysee's services to perpetrate copyright infringement, by posting content that includes copyrighted material owned by our client. We ask that Odysee immediately remove the infringing material and terminating the account responsible for posting it, consistent with Odysee's Terms of Service (https://odysee.com/$/tos).

Lyric Capital Group owns the masters and publishing rights of certain works originally produced by the band The Dropkick Murphys. Specifically, Lyric Capital Group owns the rights in and to the sound recording "The Boys Are Back", as well as the musical composition embodied therein.

A group known as The New England Nationalist Social Club, a/k/a NSC 131, recently posted a video filming their group's activities, with the recording and composition of "The Boys Are Back" played over the footage, on Odysee. The link to the video can be found here: hhttps://odysee.com/IMG_8194:7d9e68274668d8efe94c35fbbb19fe65925b6be8. Lyric Capital Group unequivocally did not authorize or consent to the use of "The Boys Are Back" in this video or by these users. Consequently, the unauthorized misuse of the recording and composition of "The Boys Are Back" constitutes clear-cut copyright infringement under federal law and Odysee's own Terms of Service. We ask that Odysee take immediate action to remedy the situation by removing the video linked here, removing any reposts of the video on Odysee, and terminating the accounts that posted the original video and any reposts. Failure to take expeditious action may subject Odysee itself to liability for deliberately participating in copyright infringement.

I hereby state that the information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that I am authorized to act on behalf of Lyric Capital Group, the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. All of our client's rights, remedies, and arguments remain expressly reserved.

Sincerely,

/s/ John Kennedy
