Hello:

My name is Dylan Buro Otero and a video channel that your company hosts is infringing my privacy rights.

The channel is: https://odysee.com/@TRAPPERIODISMO:5

And the video that is in infringing my privacy rights is: https://odysee.com/@TRAPPERIODISMO:5/yxungdy970-ense-a-su-cara-y-pide-perd-n:5

In that video my image is shown and my voice is heard without my consent from minute 0:01 until 6:50.

The owner of the channel has more videos in which my rights are infringed and In addition he/she falsely accuses me of abuse and mistreatment.

This person not only violates my copyright by publishing my voice and face without my consent, but also publicly defames me for the purpose of damaging my image.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a privacy rights lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a privacy rights infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the privacy rights involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.

Dylan Buro Otero.
