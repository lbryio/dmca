Re: Infringing Video: Odysee.com - Notice of Infringement

Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing on behalf of SONY PICTURES ANIMATION, INC. ("SPA"). SPA owns certain rights under copyright law in the motion picture, production materials, and promotional content for:

POPEYE ("Intellectual Property").

There are links on Odysee.com ("Website") that allow for the distribution, transmission, or downloading of versions of the Intellectual Property, in violation of SPA's exclusive rights under copyright law. See Exhibit A for specifics. The unauthorized distribution or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act, Title 17 U.S Code Section 106(3)-(4). This conduct may also violate the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and The Universal Copyright Convention, as well as bilateral treaties with other countries that allow for protection of SPA's copyrighted works even beyond U.S borders.

In light of the foregoing, we hereby demand that you immediately cease such unlawful activities and take steps to ensure that, in the future, your Website does not infringe upon SPA's exclusive rights under copyright. Without limitation, we demand that you immediately cease and desist from using the Website to directly or indirectly cause, contribute to, enable, facilitate, aid, abet, induce, encourage, and/or participate in the infringement of the rights held by SPA, including but not limited to the Intellectual Property as identified in the above box.

We believe this information is sufficient for you to locate and cease the infringing activities complained about herein. We are providing this notice based on our good faith belief that the use of the intellectual property owned by SPA in the manner occurring via the Website is not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents, or the law. The information in this notification is accurate. Under penalty of perjury, we are authorized to act on behalf of the owners of the exclusive rights that are being infringed. This letter is without prejudice to the rights and remedies of SPA, all of which are expressly reserved.
