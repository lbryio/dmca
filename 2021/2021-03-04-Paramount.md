Dear Sir or Madam:

We are contacting you on behalf of Paramount Pictures Corporation ("Paramount").

We have detected on your site the presence of file(s) that contain Paramount Content. The information provided below identifies the location of the file(s) on your site. We have a good faith belief that the use of this content in this manner is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Please immediately remove or block access to Paramount Content, including, without limitation, each of the URLs identified below. To the extent that your site allows multiple URLs to point to or access the content file, we request that you, at a minimum, prevent all access to the content file, not merely access through the URLs specifically identified herein.

Accordingly, we request that you take reasonable steps to remove or block access to all copies of the identified Paramount Content and to address the broader problem of infringement of Paramount Content through your site, in addition to removing or blocking access to the specific URLs identified below. We further request that you use the information provided in this notice to identify the users responsible for posting the files and to terminate the accounts of users who are "repeat infringers." See 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(i)(1)(A).

We urge you to take immediate action to stop this infringing activity and to inform us of the actions you have taken and their results. To that end, please send us a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken to resolve this matter, making sure to reference the Notice ID number above in your response.

Nothing in this letter shall operate as a waiver of any rights, claims or remedies available to Paramount with respect to the infringement alleged herein. All such rights, claims and remedies are hereby expressly reserved.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. You may reach me via email at agent@paramount.copyright-notice.com, by telephone at (408) 217-5000, or by regular mail at 2880 Lakeside Dr, Ste 360, Santa Clara, CA 95054.
