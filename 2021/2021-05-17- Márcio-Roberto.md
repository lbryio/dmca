My name is MÃ¡rcio Roberto de Andrade and I am responsible for the Survivor's Guide. A profile that your company hosts (https://odysee.com/@sobrevivencialismo_copy) is infringing at least one copyright owned by my company.

All material was copied to its servers without permission. The original content, for which we own exclusive copyrights, can be found at:

https://www.guiadosobrevivente.com.br and

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

This letter is an official notification under Section 512 (c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek to remove the above infringing material from its servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform him of your obligation to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify him to cease any future posting of infringing material on your server.

We also inform you that the law requires that you, as a service provider, remove or disable access to infringing materials when you receive this notice. Under United States law, a service provider, like you, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit, provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify the ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material, that immunity will be forfeited. Therefore, in order to remain immune to a copyright infringement action, you will need to investigate and, ultimately, remove or disable infringing material from your servers at the appropriate speed if the direct infringer, your customer, does not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with a reasonable belief that my company's property rights are being violated. Under penalty of perjury, I certify that the information contained in the notification is true and accurate and I have the authority to act on behalf of the copyright owner involved.

If you wish to discuss this with me, please contact me directly.

Thanks.

Marcio Roberto de Andrade
