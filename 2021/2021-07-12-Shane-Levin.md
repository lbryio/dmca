My name is Shane Levin. A website that your company hosts (@martinezperspective) is infringing on at least one of my rights.

As stated in the previous report when I first reported the video. The owner of the account did not inform me I was being filmed or that he was to be uploading it on this platform. I had no way of being formally or informally that this was going to be uploaded. I do not want to be associated with this channel or to have videos of me being posted by them. Therefore I am here to ask you to please remove the video:

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

This letter is official notification that I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.
