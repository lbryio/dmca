Counter claim received on 8/31/2021. Claimant will be notified via email. If no court order is received, content will be restored on Sept 15, 2021

Dear LBRY,
This office has the pleasure of representing The Gatalog, Gatalog Foundation,
et al in all matters relating to intellectual property. As such, this office acts on behalf
of the Gatalog and its members.
This office is in receipt of the copy of the letter sent to you by Mme Galloway,
representative of EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY ACTION FUND, INC, alleging
violations of intellectual property rights (the “Everytown notice”).
This letter is intended as a Counter-Notification as authorized by 17
U.S.C. § 512(g). My client has a good faith belief that the material which was
removed or disabled as a result of the Everytown notice was as a result of mistake or
misidentification of the material. I therefore request that the material be replaced
and/or no long be disabled.
The content wrongfully removed was previously found at the following
addresses:

• https://odysee.com/@TheGatalog-
Accessories:e/MomsDemandFullAuto3DPrintableSwiftLink:3

• https://odysee.com/@xYeezySZN:f/MomsDemandFirebolt:7
• https://odysee.com/@xYeezySZN:f/EverytownFireboltMagwell:f

• https://odysee.com/@TheGatalog-PrintableMagazines:6/everytown-cmmg-
22lr-mag-25round:f

This office is of the position that it is manifestly clear that the above referenced
materials cannot reasonably be understood to be violative of Everytown’s intellectual
property, that the works are manifestly distinct from any and all Everytown marks,
that the works are protected parody—to any extent they are similar—and that the
Everytown notice was issued fraudulently.

9/15/2021 - no counter claim received, content will be back up shortly.
