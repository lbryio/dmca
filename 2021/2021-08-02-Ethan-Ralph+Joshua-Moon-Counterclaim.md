My name is Ethan Ralph and I am the MANAGER OF PEACEFUL SUNSET PRODUCTIONS LLC. A website that your company hosts (according to WHOIS information) is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

An article was copied onto your servers without permission. The original ARTICLE/PHOTO, to which we own the exclusive copyrights, can be found at:

https://odysee.com/@theralphretort:1/chris-chan-search-party:8

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.

ETHAN RALPH

**Counter claim submitted on 8/2/2021. Claimant notified and will have 10 days to produce court documents that re-affrims their position. If 10 days passes, and no such proof is entered, the video will be reinstated:**

I have a good faith belief that the content is transformative and fair
in its use.

1. The video is a recording of a screen, not a direct copy of the
claimant's alleged work.

2. The video is used to report on a significant news story.

3. The Claimant is mentioning me by name throughout the last fifth half
of the video.

As a concession to the Claimant, per his request, I have added credit to
the description.

Submitted under penalty of perjury.
