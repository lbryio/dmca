Notice of Unauthorized use of Arthur Kemp's material

Dear Sir or Madam:

I, Arthur Kemp, of the physical address below, swear under penalty of perjury that I have detected infringements of my copyright interests as detailed in the report below.

I have reasonable good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of in the report below is not authorized by myself, my agents, or the law. The information provided herein is accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Therefore, this letter is an official notification to effect removal of the detected infringement listed in the report below. The report below specifies the exact location of the infringement.

I hereby request that you immediately remove or block access to the infringing material, as specified in the copyright laws, and insure the user refrains from using or sharing with others the unauthorized materials in the future (see, 17 U.S.C. 512).

Please send a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken to resolve this matter, making sure to reference DMCA-CASE# MOT888 in your response.

Nothing in this letter shall serve as a waiver of any rights or remedies of Arthur Kemp with respect to the alleged infringement, all of which are expressly reserved.

If you need to contact me, my contact information is located at the bottom of this letter.

The information contained herein is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I assert that I am the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Evidentiary Information:

Infringing URL(s):

https://odysee.com/@DigitalAlexandria:5/Arthur-Kemp---March-of-the-Titans:7

https://odysee.com/@DigitalAlexandria:5/Arthur-Kemp---March-Of-The-Titans:c

Explanation:

These are illegal and unauthorised copies of a copyrighted work which is a gross infringement on the intellectual property of the author.

The original work is commercially for sale and can be found on the publisher's website here:

https://ostarapublications.com/product/march-of-the-titans-the-complete-history-of-the-white-race-single-volume-edition/

The unauthorized, illegal and pirated version of this work is therefore causing the author and copyright holder financial harm, and furthermore, as the author has no control over the content of said website, is unable to monitor additions or amendments which may then be ascribed to his name by the general public.

This situation is completely unacceptable, and is a gross and flagrant violation of the copyright as under the DCMA. It must be removed with immediate effect.
