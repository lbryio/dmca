There are two instances of copyright violations involved in this dispute, apparently by two different parties. The first infringer is @yabba (https://odysee.com/@yabba:e). The second infringer is @TheBraveNewNormal (https://odysee.com/@TheBraveNewNormal:d). Each of them has pirated my original creative content in audio-video and/or text format on your platform.

As the artist, The Sharper Sword, I created the movie called "MANDATORY MIND CONTROL: Soma, Neuralink, and the Brave New Normal" (https://odysee.com/@thesharpersword:f/Soma_Movie_FinalEdit_1:e), and I first published it on September 1, 2020 on Youtube, as the full length MOVIE (1 hour and 43 minutes) alongside a second post on the same day comprising the ending MONTAGE from that movie as a 2:28 clip. Youtube has since deleted the full length movie but not the montage (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZxP-IIsY7g).

See attached screenshots: "Youtube content index annotated 2021-11-05" (showing both the movie and the montage in my Youtube Studio back-end stamped with September 1, 2020 publication dates) and "YT removal notice Screenshot 2021-11-05" (showing the Youtube Removal Notice I recently received which contains the DESCRIPTIVE TEXT that I wrote for the shownotes of the movie).

The first infringer @yabba posted an unauthorized copy of the full length MOVIE on your platform in violation of my copyright on January 2, 2021 (link: https://odysee.com/@yabba:e/-BRAVE-NEW-NORMAL-(Mandatory-Mind-Control-in-the-'New-Electro-Psychotropic-World-Order')-:1 ) and also plagiarized my descriptive text in said infringing post.

The second infringer @TheBraveNewNormal copied the title of my MOVIE verbatim and advertised it without my knowledge or permission on your platform (https://odysee.com/@TheBraveNewNormal:d/SomaNeuralink:a) on November 29, 2020, wherein attribution was not given to me but instead given to @TheBraveNewNormal. Two hyperlinks accompany the infringing post: the first hyperlink points to the URL on YouTube where my first publication of the MOVIE was hosted (before the removal notice), and the second hyperlink points to the second infringer's own channel, where said second hyperlink is published immediately adjacent to the first hyperlink on the same page and next to a "Follow" button for @TheBraveNewNormal.

The infringers have caused harm to my reputation and livelihood in at least two ways:

Firstly, both infringers engaged in activity that intentionally associates my name and content with their own in the public perception, stealing viewership from my channels and diluting my brand.

Secondly, @yabba illegally republished my MOVIE in a lower-quality video file (presumably because it was ripped from the Youtube server), and both infringers published my creative content in their media spaces which are less extensive and intensive compared to mine, thus diminishing the impact of my content upon viewers when viewed on the infringer's media spaces. My channels have existed for up to 7 years online and contain thousands of hours of audio/video content plus carefully crafted descriptions and expressions which overexcell those of both infringers.

Thirdly, because I did not publish my MOVIE on your platform until March 7, 2021 (more than 2 months after @yabba posted it), @yabba generates the false perception that I am an infringer and @yabba is the author. Because @yabba has over 700 followers on your platform, whereas I only have 2, this has caused incalculable damage to my success on Odysee.com. A viewer need not have actually visited the page containing the infringing post to have been deceived, but could have been misled simply by viewing a thumbnail of the infringing post anywhere on your platform.

I respectfully request that @yabba, and whomever owns or operates @yabba, be prohibited from using any descriptive text, audio-video, or other content that belongs to me and The Sharper Sword brand on your platform forever. I would also pray for an award of LBC as compensatory damages in whatever amount you deem fair according to your experience and expertise in such matters according to these circumstances.

I would be willing to grant the second infringer @TheBraveNewNormal a revocable license without royalties to continue maintaining the infringing post only if YOU publish accreditation to me on said page in a way that cannot be undone by @TheBraveNewNormal, or YOU arrange for some sort of royalty compensations to be paid automatically to me according to your assessment of what is feasible and fair for similarly situated parties. Otherwise I request that all posts using my creative content, including unique titles and descriptive text, be removed from all media space under the control of whatever parties operate and manage @TheBraveNewNormal.

Thank You.

Sincerely,

Ian Coyle, JD, PhD.
a.k.a. John Sharper, The Sharper Sword.
