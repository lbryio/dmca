Hello, this is Kim MyeongJin, a member of VALOFE business division 2


I am writing this email for reporting and requesting to take a private server's file download route down.
This URL download route of the private server name Divine Icarus, which I am asking to takedown the account and file route:
- https://odysee.com/@Maggot:9/DI-IC-April21:6?r=FgcJ25tb6bfJGhfBQYs8s3igfQAYHLEj&sunset=lbrytv


and this is the URL of the private server
- https://ic.divinegames.to/


The URL I am being reporting is a download files of the game Icarus's private server.
The private server has no authorization of original developer or us.


Icarus is the RPG online PC game, currently serviced globally, and developed by Wemade granting the full rights of publishing the game service on globally to VALOFE.


VALOFE would like to request to block the illegal site globally.
VALOFE has full rights to act legal response regarding the game.


You can find our service on the following URL;
- https://icarus-na.valofe.com/
- https://vfun.valofe.com/home


and this is the link of the power of attorney granted the legal right to handle Private servers of Icarus game:
- https://xiyouxiqj.sharepoint.cn/:b:/t/05Contract/EXBBQyuf9ydLph3WPw065fwBhtcGJbGul6QzIziWEieSbw?e=dXbQ0a


Please consider that the Private servers are the serious problems which ruin all internet game business.


I hope your reply soon with good result for us.


Thank you


Sincerely,
Kim MyeongJin
