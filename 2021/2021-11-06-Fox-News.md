These channels are infringing on the copyrights of Fox News. Fox News is the exclusive rights holder in the Program and we are authorized to act on its behalf. Because Fox News has not licensed the Program to Odysee nor any of the channels in question, we have a good faith belief that these pages are committing copyright infringement.


We request that you immediately take down these pages and not allow the channels or anyone else to further infringe on the copyrights of Fox News via the Odysee platform.


Please note we write without waiving any of the rights and remedies of Fox News, its parent, and affiliates, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.
