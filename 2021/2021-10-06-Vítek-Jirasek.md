Hello,


Thank you very much for your advise and help. We really do appreciate your
assistance. We're attaching the takedown request for the whole channel
according to the pattern on the website you've provided us.



My name is Vítek Jirasek and I am the broadcaster and owner of the studio
for Free broadcasting radio station in the Czech Republic (Svobodny vysilac
in Czech language). A Channel that Odysee hosts

https://odysee.com/@jardaradiometacz:4

is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my Studio of the radio
station company.


Our broadcasted programs have been copied onto Odysee servers without our
permission. The original programs, to which we own the exclusive copyrights,
can be found at:

http://www.odysee.com/@radiosvstudiotapinradio

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

https://odysee.com/@jardaradiometacz:4

They intentionally split programs into more pieces and purposely have
slightly different titles for programs making it more difficult to be found.
Examples for programs to be removed are:

and similar titles further.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the
aforementioned infringing material from Odysee. I request that you
immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their
duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to
cease any further posting of infringing material to Odysee in the future.
Maybe make impossible to automatically copy programs from Youtube to their
account on Odysee.


Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to
remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this
notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity
from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to
investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service
providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material
this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a
copyright infringement action you will need to investigate and ultimately
remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from Odysee with all
due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.


I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief
that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury I
certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and
accurate, and I have the authority to act as the copyright(s) owner
involved.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.
Thank you.
