A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner.
The artwork featured in the video at the provided timestamp belongs to myself (Username: AceTheMech) as the commissioner (Person who pays the artist to make the art for my own personal use) as well as the artist, who goes by Kaosst. Neither of us were ever contacted by the owner of the video to ask for permission to use the art in their video. It is believed that this was never done for any art or pictures shown in the video.

A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed.
