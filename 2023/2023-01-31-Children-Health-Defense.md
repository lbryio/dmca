Dear Sir or Madam,

I represent Children's Health Defense, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. It has been brought to my attention that an unknown person has created an account with Odysee and is impersonating our organization and broadcasting videos protected by copyright and trademark laws.

The imposter's website with Odysee is https://odysee.com/@CHD.TV:9

Our website is https://childrenshealthdefense.org. The name Children's Health Defense is protected by copyright law. Likewise, the Children's Health Defense logo is a registered trademark. The blatant use of both the Children's Health Defense name and logo are copyright and trademark infringements.

Representatives from CHD have sent multiple requests for the removal of the imposter from Odysee's website. We have not received a response.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Children's Health Defense demands the removal of the website from your domain. If you do not remove the website, we will be forced to take legal action.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Rolf Hazlehurst
Senior Staff Attorney
Children's Health Defense
