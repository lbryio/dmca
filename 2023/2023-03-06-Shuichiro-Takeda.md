Dear Odysee.

This video was originally posted at the following URL on 9/15/2020 with the same title by a person named Masayuki Hiratsuka, who is neither the poster of this Odysee video nor myself.

The original video is no longer available. However, the video contains defamatory contents about me, and I filed a lawsuit against the original poster, Hiratsuka, at Chiba District Court in Japan. A court settlement was reached between Hiratsuka and me on Oct 28, 2022, which includes a copyright transfer agreement of this video from Hiratsuka to me. Hence I'm the copyright holder of this video now.

I believe this video on Odysee was uploaded by someone other than Hiratsuka. But I, the current copyrightholder of this video, do not allow anyone to upload the video to any website. Hence I ask Odysee to remove this video under DMCA.

A copy of the original court settlement is attached in this email, though it is in Japanese. This video is listed in item 13 in page 7 of the settlement, and the copyright transfer agreement is written in item 3 in page 4. I'm willing to translate the relevant part to English if necessary.

Sincerely,
Shuichiro Takeda
