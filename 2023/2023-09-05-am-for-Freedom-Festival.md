Hi Odysee team,

My name is Cambel McLaughlin and I am the company director and event organiser behind Jam for Freedom Festival. Our company is registered in the UK.

The creator and uploader of the video (Nick Cotton, AKA Scum Media or Jack'd) has been operating a campaign of harassment with malicious intent which is illegal under UK law. He has been reported to the police and he is currently under investigation. For verification the crime reference number for Thames Valley Police is here: 43230395417 101:0965711

The videos in question have been used as key evidence in this crime as it indicates a clear pattern of malicious harassment.

The two videos in question are:

Introduction

Nicholas Cotton (AKA Scum Media) has been involved in continuous harassment of Cambel McLaughlin and defaming his business. Nicholas was asked to work as a stage manager at a recent event that Cambel put on which was a small family friendly music festival that was approved by East Herts Police. This was called Jam for Freedom Festival. Nick left the event before doing any work after claiming he was ill and has since gone on a campaign of harassment with malicious intent and defamation of Cambel and his music festival for a month now. He started by uploading a 30 minute video to YouTube about Cambel and his business and it was reported for defamation and taken down by YouTube under UK law. He then has continued to spread rumours, lies and threatening to harass Cambel further which we have proof of.

We have a video clip of Nicholas Cotton on his own podcast claiming that 'it is immense fun to bully' and he 'is going to make his life harder over the next few months' referring to Cambel. This indicates malicious intent to continue his campaign of harassment. I can send this through. Or more easily you can watch the video on a link here: https://odysee.com/@UNWAShED:8/jam-for-freedom-nick,-sean,-tommy-export-4:f The statement is made at time stamp - 1:49:40

Nicholas has a public telegram group called @unwashed2020 which can be viewed at https://t.me/unwashed2020
His channel description also states on telegram that he is a 'proud bully'. On previous comments he has also stated 'I am a professional troll' This comment is about someone else he was harassing but this clearly shows this is a pattern of behaviour from Nicholas. There has been over 30 comments and posts from Nicholas himself either about Cambel or his business. These are all posts and comments of harassment and bullying of that sort. He has also made another video, almost 2 hours long on his Odysee channel that is defaming Cambel again, all the way through. This is the same link that has been sent.

He has also said in a previous comment encouraging others to go to Cambel's supposed home address in Luton, England. This was Cambel's previous registered business address. Luckily he had the wrong address but the intent was there to cause stress and encourage harassment from others. This has been on going for a whole month, nearly every single day, and he is adamant to continue this campaign of harassment.

This is affecting Cambel's mental health dramatically as he is waking up to more messages every day from various peoples as Nicholas has a wide audience of similar personalities that troll and harass. Cambel is suffering from anxiety and depression due to these behaviours.

We also have an email of Youtube confirming the content that Nicholas uploaded has been blocked for view due to defamation.

Evidence of malicious intent and a campaign of harrassment
In video 2 there is a video clip of Nicholas stating he is 'going to make his life harder over the next few months', he being Cambel. This statement is made at time stamp - 1:49:40

This breaches your community guidelines of not bullying.

Copyright breach + DMCA request.
The creator at the end of the video uses my copyrighted song for 2 minutes and 2 seconds from 30.12-32.14. The creator has not had permission from the song writer, Cambel McLaughlin (myself) to use this song. The song is titled 'Life of a Rebel' by Jam for Freedom. Evidence for the signwriting credit is attached to this email.

The fact the uploader of the video did not request my permission to use this song, on a video defaming and bullying me, indicates his levels of bullying and harassment.

I hereby request that the video also be taken down with reference to this DMCA request, however I also feel that due to the nature of the video and its breach of community guidelines that it be removed indefinitely.

Defamation
I understand that it is not under the Odysee policy to remove videos due to defamation requests. However I am including this to let you know the severity of the issue.

The statements are defamatory as they allege criminal acts which have not been proven in a court of law. This obliges the publisher (Odysee) under UK law to remove this content through Section 13 of the Defamation Act 2013.

YouTube has already removed the same video under a defamation request.

Below are defamatory statements from the video and timestamps below from it as evidence

1. Defamatory statement that organiser has broken laws that he has not. 'Breaking laws in place before covid but acting as if this was a legitimate protest against government tyranny.... Cambel would break these laws over and over'
2. Comparison to a completely different festival (Fyre Festival) and imagery in the background to imply a scam or a fraud as this festival was subject to a $100 million law suit and the organiser sentenced to prison for 6 years for fraud.
3. Untrue statement: 'a ban on cooking your own food'. Our festival allowed cooking of food.
4. Sharing our private messages without context or full discussion and without my permission.
5. Implying a scam: 'jam for freedom has always been... getting himself arrested so he can scam fans for donations '
6. Further defamation of character: 'swindle and mislead people'
7. Pure defamation, not proven in any court of law: 'Cambel is a con man'

Timestamps:
1: 3.20-3.30 2: 9.18-10.3 3: 12.20-12.25 4. 9.35-9.50 5: 31.00-31.10 6: 31.18-31.20
7: 31.24-31.27

I have also attached pictures evidencing this campaign of harassment, trolling and bullying.

I'm a fan of Odysee
I just wanted to add that I've uploaded many hours of videos to Odysee and have been an early adopter, promoting it across our worldwide gigs and tours.

I hope that you will be able to see my point of view. This kind of content does not foster a positive creative spirit and I will personally not promote Odysee or consider working alongside you until this issue is resolved. I do not want people to be led to a platform where campaigns of bullying can occur (even criminal harassment) alongside defamation. We can all do better than this.

Please update me on my requests here before I pursue legal action, as you can understand this is an extremely serious issue.

Best wishes,
