To whom it may concern,
We are writing to you on behalf of our client, Mr. Michel Rodellas Picola, who recently has had notice about the publication of content on your platform LBRY (https://lbry.tv/) (hereinafter, referred to as “the Platform”) without his knowledge and, of course, without its consent to do so. All in all, the publication of said content goes against the copyright and other intellectual and proprietary rights protected by the law, in the terms that are expressed below.

Indeed, through the use of your Platform, the user whose identification URL is: lbry://@elvilleroPDF#c and his Claim ID is: c2d8b6c044feb48ae050a6437eee18f64e2b7b6b (hereinafter, referred to as “the User”), has been publishing, distributing and selling two books of which he holds neither the author’s rights, nor copyright, nor the consent to carry out such actions

The first book subject to the complaint is called “LOS PAIOS”, available through the following link https://lbry.tv/@elvilleroPDF:c/LOS-PAIOS---Alexander-Eleazar-:4. In the description of this link you can see how the User labels the book’s license as “None”, however, this is completely false. As you can see in Annex 1, this book has been correctly registered in the Intellectual Property Registry of Catalonia (Spain) since 2017. In addition, within the book, in the first pages the reader is both informed and warned that, precisely, the book is registered and has the protection conferred by copyright (Annex 2). Please, note that both Annexes includes the name of our client, Mr. Michel Rodellas Picola. For more abundance, we attach as Annex 3, a photograph of the book in its original version where our client appears as the sole author.

The second book refers to “LOS BERE” available through the following link: https://lbry.tv/@elvilleroPDF:c/LOS-BERE---ALEXANDRE-ELEAZAR-:d. In this case, the author is not our client, but his father, Alexandre Eleazar. To corroborate that my client is the legitimate son of Alexandre Eleazar, find attached as Annex 4, the father's death certificate where it can be seen that the surname “Rodellas” (which is his real one) proves the paternal-filial relationship. In fact, the real name of our client’s father was Eleazar Luciano Rodellas Mendez, but when writing he used to use the pseudonym “Alexandre Eleazar”. We also enclose a copyright cut that certifies the ownership of my client's father, as well as the original of the book (Annex 5). Again, in this case, the User is publishing this book without any prior consent of the legitimate heir. Whatsmore, the book was published in 1985 which means that the exploitation rights still persist due to 70 years have not yet passed since its disclosure.

Having said that before, we remind you that publish, distribute or sell content without having
the prior consent to do so constitutes a violation of the provisions established in Royal
Legislative Decree 1/1996, of April 12, which approves the consolidated text of the Intellectual
Property Law, regularizing, clarifying and harmonizing the legal provisions current on the matter
(Spanish Law). But not only does it violate Spanish regulatory provisions, but also the laws
established in the United States, where you have your headquarters and where the Platform
operates. In the United States intellectual property law is governed by both federal and state
legislation, as well as being subject to international conventions implemented by the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). All of the
legal provisions established by legislation and its implementing organizations prohibits
plagiarism and reproduction, distribution and sale without due copyright permission.

In any case, in your Terms of Service, clause 3 letter f) on Publishing Content, you say verbatim:
“You will not use the Services to distribute or publish Content that: infringes any patent,
trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party”. For
that reason, we urge you to take appropriate steps to enforce not only your own terms of use of
the Platform, but also the law.

For all the above, we request that you immediately prevent the User to continue publishing
content without permission nor authorization and remove any reference, link or file available
for downloading the books “LOS PAIOS” and “LOS BERE”, both for infringing the regulations
on intellectual property and copyright. We also request you to inform us in writing of your
decision regarding this requirement. Upon receiving the letter, it is considered that you already
have effective knowledge of the complaint and that, depending on what you do, you may be
responsible for the content published by your users on this issue.

If in the non-extendable period of 10 calendar days from the date of receipt of this document
we have not seen our request met we reserve the right to take as many legal actions as are
within our reach for the best defence of the rights and interests of our client, Mr. Michel
Rodellas Picola, including the claim for any damages that may correspond.

Without further ado and waiting to receive news from you, receive a cordial greeting.
